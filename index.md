Hello! My name is Vadym Voitsekhovskyi. I am a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics and softare developer for the Cherenkov camera control software. 

I am an amator chess player (currently on my way to 2000 FIDE rating), slow runner (on my way to marathon finish), mediocre guitar player (on my way to play Hotel California guitar solo) and future software architect (on my way to understand what it means).

Here I will share my notes about topics that I learned during my climbing on each of abovementioned ways.
