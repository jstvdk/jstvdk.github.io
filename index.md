Hello! My name is Vadym Voitsekhovskyi. I am a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics and softare developer for the Cherenkov camera control software. 

I am an amator chess player (currently on my way to 2000 FIDE rating), runner (on my way to marathon finish), mediocre guitar player (on my way to play Hotel California guitar solo) and passionate software engineer (on my way to software architect role).

Here I will share my notes about evolving in each of the topics that are interested to me.
