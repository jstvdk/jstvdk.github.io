title: "To leptonic or to not leptonic"
excerpt: "Distinguish between hadronic and leptonic emission"
---


- Spectral index: Leptonic 1/2 (q + 1) vs Hadronic as usual just a q so approx 2.
- Higher densities of the medium favor the hadronic
- In high magnetic fields the leptons will lose energy very quickly
- Pion bump around GeV energies, cut off below 200 MeV
- Thermal x-ray component?
